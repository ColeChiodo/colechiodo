### 👋🤠 Howdy! I'm Cole!

I'm a Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area 🌉.

I am passionate about building software because I want to build things that are intuitive, engaging, and accessible for any user. I am particularly motivated by the idea that technology should work for people, not the other way around. Observing how often technology feels frustrating or inaccessible has inspired me to create solutions that prioritize the user experience.

During my undergrad, I took a Human-Computer Interaction course, which deepened my understanding of how design, usability, and user behavior intersect in software development. This experience reinforced my goal to craft technology that serves people effectively, combining technical skill with thoughtful design to create applications that are not only functional but also enjoyable to use.
